# Compile it

Using `mvn`, `./mvnw` or even `./mvnw.cmd` depending on your platform.

You need at least Java 15 to compile or run it

`mvn clean package` will run the tests and produce:
 - a small jar at `target/lawn-and-mower-1.0.0-runner.jar.original` (< 30k) 
 - a fat jar at `target/lawn-and-mower-1.0.0-runner.jar` (< 3m) 

`mvn clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true` will produce a docker image named `lawn-and-mower` with tag `1.0.0`

`mvn compile quarkus:dev` will compile into dev mode for fast rerun when you modify something

# Goal

Build a program that implements the following mower specification.

## Pitch

The client, company X, wants to develop an algorithm to mow **rectangular surfaces**. 
`A bit confusing as movements are actually already in the inputs`

Mowers can be programmed to move throughout the **entire surface**.

## Specs as given
 
A mower's position is represented by **Cartesian coordinates (X, Y)**, and an **orientation (N, E, W, S)**.

The lawn is divided into a **grid** to simplify navigation.

*For example, the position 0,0,N indicates the mower is in the lower left corner of the lawn facing north.*

To move the mower, we use a series of a combination of the following **commands: L, R, and F**.

**L** and **R** **turn** the mower 90Â° left or right **without moving** the mower.
**F** means **move forward** one space in the direction the mower is currently facing without changing its orientation.

If a forward movement would cause the mower to **move outside** of the lawn, the mower **remains** in the position **and** this **command is discarded**.
 
The position directly to the north of *(X, Y)* is *(X, Y+ 1)* and the position to the east of *(X, Y)* is *(X + 1, Y)*.

Different mowers may **not occupy the same space at the same time**,
 and if a mower receives a **move forward** instruction that would cause it to **run into another mower**,
 the move forward instruction is **silently discarded**.
 
`assumption here: as seen later, moves can be run in //, they would both not move to this space ?`

Your simulation will be run on a machine with multiple CPUs so multiple **mowers should be processed simultaneously** in order to speed up the overall execution time.

## Inputs

The mowers are programmed using an input **file** constructed in the following manner:

The **first line** corresponds to the **upper right corner of the lawn**.
The **bottom left** corner is implicitly **(0, 0)**.

The rest of the file describes the **multiple mowers** that are on the lawn.
Each **mower** is described on **two lines**:

The **first** line contains the mower's **starting position and orientation** in the format "X Y O". `with a space`
X and Y are the coordinates and O is the orientation.

The **second** line contains the instructions for the mower to **navigate the lawn**.
The instructions are **not separated by spaces**.

## Output

At the end of the simulation, the **final position and orientation of each mower is output in the order that the mower appeared in the input**.

When designing and implementing your solution ensure that you keep in mind separation of concerns, performance, and testing.

## Example

Input file

```
5 5
1 2 N
LFLFLFLFF
3 3 E
FFRFFRFRRF
```

Result

```
1 3 N
5 1 E
```

# Assumptions 

## Should be discussed

- Mowers have a fixed size of 1 ?
- If two mowers plan to move on the same square next turn, both moves would be invalidated. A bit like platinium rift
- They only care about the final position, not if they actually did their job ? Meh.
- looks like we favor cpu consumption over memory consumption

## Should be checked

- The grid has a size of at least one.

# Todos

- add picocli
- add option to write result at the end of file
- add useful rest endpoint 
- check on non linux machines
- deploy
- check not logged to dockerhub
- asciinema
- deliverables
